# More about me!
As you have probably read, my name is Paul Navarre. I attend a small, private school in Michigan, and I am a sophomore in High School. I am currently learning pseduocode at school in AP Computer Science Principles. It is fun, but pretty simple, so at home I am learning Python by myself. Right now I am just trying to understand everything about Python and how to start learning it. My first project will probably be a rock paper scissors project. Another hobby of mine is video editing. I have been editing video for over six years, but I recently switched my software, so I am still learning some things with that. I also enjoy listening to music and playing the drums. I have been playing the drums for pretty much my whole life. I usually listen to rock and trap music, and sometimes rap. I also play football, golf, and I am going to start powerlifting. I think that is pretty much all that I wanted to say!
